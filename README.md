# Implementing a Linear Binary Pattern (LBP) Classifier 

Overview:

This was a university mini project for the Computer Vision module. The goal of this project was to satisfy the requirements and to implement a Linear Binary Pattern (LBP) Classifier from scratch to classify faces and cars.
This mini project scored a mark of 100/100. No third party libraries were used in this project and all my written code can be found in the folder named './code/'.

A detailed report containing the requirements and discussion of implementation & results can be found at './LBP_Classifier_Report.pdf'.

Below is an example output from the classifier when the training images are labelled in black on the right most column and the images classified by the classfier are on the  2 columns on the left labelled in red.
