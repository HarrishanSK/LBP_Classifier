This was a university mini project for the Computer Vision module. The goal of this project was to satisfy the requirements and to implement a Linear Binary Pattern (LBP) Classifier from scratch to classify faces and cars.
This mini project scored a mark of 100/100. No third party libraries were used in this project and all my written codecan be found in the folder named './code/'.

A detailed report containing the requirements and discussion of implementation & results can be found at './LBP_Classifier_Report.pdf'.
